# Decoder Ring

## Project Overview
Decoder Ring is a web application that allows users to encode and decode messages using various ciphers and algorithms. Whether you're planning a surprise party or just enjoy solving puzzles, Decoder Ring provides a fun and interactive way to work with secret messages. The application supports three different ciphers: Caesar shift, Polybius square, and substitution cipher.

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to build a complex algorithm and write unit tests using Mocha and Chai. You will need to implement the encoding and decoding logic for each cipher, ensuring that the tests pass. The project emphasizes test-driven development (TDD), encouraging you to write tests first and then write the code to fulfill those tests.

## Features and Functionality
- Caesar shift: Encodes and decodes messages by shifting each letter in the alphabet by a specified number of positions.
- Polybius square: Translates each letter to a corresponding two-digit number using a Polybius square grid.
- Substitution cipher: Replaces each letter in the message with a corresponding letter from a given substitution alphabet.
- Test-driven development: Utilizes Mocha and Chai to write unit tests for each cipher, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the encoding and decoding algorithms.
- Case-insensitive and whitespace-preserving: The application handles inputs in a case-insensitive manner, and spaces are maintained before and after encoding or decoding.

## Technologies and Tools Used
- JavaScript: Programming language used for the implementation of the ciphers and algorithms.
- Mocha and Chai: Testing frameworks used for writing unit tests to validate the functionality of the encoding and decoding logic.
- Git and GitHub: Version control system and online repository for collaboration and code management.
